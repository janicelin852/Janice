project_1/time_text=2021-2022
project_1/contribution=Contribution
project_1/contribution_1=Analyzing IoT product competitors and discussing product architecture with the team
project_1/contribution_2=Process testing and grooming to keep operations of the product consistent and with enough flexibility
project_1/contribution_3=Building design systems by integrating the components and guidelines utilized in previous projects
project_1/background=Background & Problem
project_1/background_text_1=The company's primary business strategy is to develop specialized solutions for clients by project-based. In view of the future company policy, we can't keep adding staff to maintain numerous systems. So we need to create a SaaS (Software as a Service) product for energy management that can merge previous project materials and suit to future needs.
project_1/background_text_2=The Energy Management System (EMS) takes field energy measurement data, evaluates power demand, and displays it to the user in easy to read format. It enables customers to remotely monitor and schedule in order to meet energy management, power savings, and cost savings goals.
project_1/background_text_3=The product includes three webs service and one app for different users:
project_1/background_text_4=Cloud system for data collection
project_1/background_text_5=Edge system for site management
project_1/background_text_6=Deploy system and app for field staff
project_1/result=Result
project_1/result_title_1=Reduce internal staff learning load
project_1/result_text_1=The company's previous business model was project-based, and each project had its own distinct features and business logic. The operating method of each project is the same after integration with this solution, which reduces the internal staff's learning load.
project_1/result_title_2=Build a design system to maintain product consistency and accelerate development
project_1/result_text_2=To build a design system, compile and contrast all the components in previous projects. To increase the company's brand recognition, shorten the time required for future development, and act as a development standard for outsourcers.
project_1/result_title_3=Organize the company's sporadic project data to make future data use easier
project_1/result_text_3=Each project's system design logic is unique, and the same for the data that was collected. For use in future data analysis, review, and verification, this solution harmonizes the format and structure of data collection.
project_1/challenge=Challenge
project_1/challenge_title_1=Understand past projects and take over design
project_1/challenge_text_1=Without other designers to ask, it was the first challenge to quickly familiarize myself with the company's projects and the design logic of the former designers.
project_1/challenge_title_2=New business model
project_1/challenge_text_2=I had to extract the company's past experience into a set of SaaS products and implement a new business model, which was a big challenge for me as I was not familiar with this industry and had no experience in product design.
project_1/process=Process
project_1/research=Discovery & Ideate
project_1/research_text_1=Based on previous project experience, we know what fundamental features are required for IoT products, and then I use competitive analysis to evaluate the current industry position and trends.
project_1/research_text_2=Because the bulk of the competitors are B2B, purchasing them for usage is nearly impossible. I explored the product in three ways: the first was to directly register to use the free version, the second was to read the product's user guide, and the third was to join the product's community to get a firsthand look at current user complaints.
project_1/research_text_3=After research and evaluation, the product's direction:
project_1/research_text_4=Give internal staff flexibility to satisfy 80% of client demands
project_1/research_text_5=Rapid installation and maintenance functionality
project_1/research_text_6=Numerous testing and monitoring requirements
project_1/research_text_7=The design is based on the principle of
project_1/research_text_8=quick operation, quick review, and the simplest process
project_1/research_text_9=for the target group.
project_1/framework=System Framework
project_1/framework_text=The entire product is made up of three systems: a cloud system for data collection and monitoring, an edge system for managing and testing, and a deploy system for pre-construction. These systems then provide the corresponding system functions according to the requirements of the client.
project_1/flow=Define flow
project_1/flow_text=The internal staff had to spend a lot of time learning and understanding the varied operations that the project-based design in the past. We have created a standard and simple method by combining and contrasting the variations in the processes.
project_1/design_iterate=Design & Iterate
project_1/design_iterate_title_1=The original solution
project_1/design_iterate_text_1=Although some users are satisfied with the UI display level, it does not meet the rapid operation demand of FAE.
project_1/design_iterate_title_2=Iterate 1 - Card display
project_1/design_iterate_text_2=The card-based view displays key information so that FAE can quickly review and select problem devices for repair. But the versions won't be able to match the demands of quick screening and simultaneously viewing many devices, even though they are appropriate for this purpose.
project_1/design_iterate_title_3=Solution Metric
project_1/design_iterate_text_3=I organized all our demands and compared the solutions. Finally, we chose the solution that can solve the maximum demands.
project_1/design_iterate_title_4=Final - Flat table display
project_1/design_iterate_text_4=We finally chose flat table display to satisfy the demands of rapid operation and viewing. This solution satisfies the general operation of field staff and the advanced demands of FAE.
project_1/design_guideline=Design Guideline
project_1/design_guideline_text=After we decided to develop a design system, I started to organize all the project's components then refer to the design systems of major companies, list the components we need and their variations. We used Storybook to let team members see the progress and test.
project_1/final_design=Final Design
project_1/final_design_title_1=Layout for past and future projects
project_1/final_design_text_1=We are lucky that we had the opportunity to test the solution with an ongoing project to figure out the best way to proceed for the present scenario and to satisfy the requirements of previous projects.
project_1/final_design_title_2=Flexible config concept
project_1/final_design_text_2=The majority of the product's time is spent in this function for discussion and adjustment. To prevent internal staff from having to create duplicate adaptations for various clients. We have taken the configurable areas from the project experience and have reviewed the structure and feasibility with all stakeholders.
project_1/final_design_title_3=FAE tool
project_1/final_design_text_3=I, PM, and engineers spent a lot of time clarifying and communicating due to the unfamiliarity of FAE's job. We initially attempted a rapid dichotomous solution, however this resulted in a departure. In the end, we deeply understood how the device worked and came up with a  solution with fresh perspective.
project_1/final_design_title_4=Role and permission management functions
project_1/final_design_text_4=In the past, the project has used fixed roles, and set permissions for accounts to create, read, update, and delete. This time, we offers role creation and permission settings in order to allow for future development and customisation.
project_1/take_away=Take away
project_1/take_away_title_1=Understanding challenges and problems when exploring unfamiliar area, and collaborating to find solutions
project_1/take_away_text_1=I spent a lot of time learning about the project, including the users, tools, development process, workings of the system, data flows, etc. Because I was very unfamiliar with the industry. As the solo designer of the system, it is my responsibility to first understand the communication procedures and limitations that apply to each modification of the hardware and software. I must then consult with the team to provide a generic and flexible solution.
project_1/take_away_title_2=Break the rules in time to accommodate real-world requirements
project_1/take_away_text_2=In general, I consider sequential operation and a well organized screen to be highly essential, but they may sometimes limit operation. We have a better understanding of the site's actual space limits in this iteration, which is more in line with the actual operating requirements, and we've also keep flexible extension.
project_1/take_away_title_3=Write a part of Product Requirements Document (PRD)
project_1/take_away_text_3=I attempted to write a small amount of the Product Requirements Document (PRD) while developing this product, which gave me a better understanding of the logic behind the PM's writing process, the information that different roles need to see, and how the PRD supports team communication and scope management.
