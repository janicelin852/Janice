project_1/challenge_title_1=Understand past projects and take over design
project_1/challenge_text_1=Without other designers to ask, it was the first challenge to quickly familiarize myself with the company's projects and the design logic of the former designers.
project_1/challenge_title_2=New business model
project_1/challenge_text_2=I had to extract the company's past experience into a set of SaaS products and implement a new business model, which was a big challenge for me as I was not familiar with this industry and had no experience in product design.
project_1/process=Process
project_1/research=Discovery & Ideate
project_1/research_text_1   =   We conducted a competition analysis to better grasp the market trend and positioning. The bulk of the competing products are B2B, and there are three ways to research them: first, by signing up directly; second, by checking the product manual if you cannot register; and third, by participating in the product's community and actually watching the issues consumers face.
project_1/research_text_2   =   
project_1/research_text_3   =  After research and evaluation, the product's direction:
project_1/research_text_4=Give internal staff flexibility to satisfy 80% of client demands

project_1/research_text_7=The design is based on the principle of
project_1/research_text_8=quick operation, quick review, and the simplest process
project_1/research_text_9=for the target group.
project_1/framework=System Framework
project_1/framework_text=The entire product is made up of three systems: a cloud system for data collection and monitoring, an edge system for managing and testing, and a deploy system for pre-construction. These systems then provide the corresponding system functions according to the requirements of the client.

project_1/interview =   Internal Interview
project_1/interview_text = I collaborated with the PM to interview system users from several departments in order to better understand their work processes and operational habits.  
project_1/persona   =   Persona
project_1/persona_text   =   After the interviews, it was established that there are three types of roles that will use the platform internally, and three types of external users were also summarized.

project_1/flow=Define flow
project_1/flow_text=The internal staff had to spend a lot of time learning and understanding the varied operations that the project-based design in the past. We have created a standard and simple method by combining and contrasting the variations in the processes.

project_1/final_design_title_4=Role and permission management functions
project_1/final_design_text_4=In the past, the project has used fixed roles, and set permissions for accounts to create, read, update, and delete. This time, we offers role creation and permission settings in order to allow for future development and customisation.
project_1/take_away=Take away
project_1/take_away_title_1=Understanding challenges and problems when exploring unfamiliar area, and collaborating to find solutions
project_1/take_away_text_1=I spent a lot of time learning about the project, including the users, tools, development process, workings of the system, data flows, etc. Because I was very unfamiliar with the industry. As the solo designer of the system, it is my responsibility to first understand the communication procedures and limitations that apply to each modification of the hardware and software. I must then consult with the team to provide a generic and flexible solution.
project_1/take_away_title_2=Break the rules in time to accommodate real-world requirements
project_1/take_away_text_2=In general, I consider sequential operation and a well organized screen to be highly essential, but they may sometimes limit operation. We have a better understanding of the site's actual space limits in this iteration, which is more in line with the actual operating requirements, and we've also keep flexible extension.
project_1/take_away_title_3=Write a part of Product Requirements Document (PRD)
project_1/take_away_text_3=I attempted to write a small amount of the Product Requirements Document (PRD) while developing this product, which gave me a better understanding of the logic behind the PM's writing process, the information that different roles need to see, and how the PRD supports team communication and scope management.

project_4/take_away	=	Take Away
project_4/take_away_title_1	=	Using engineering thinking to overcome logical weaknesses
project_4/take_away_text_1	=	After having several conversations with the engineers, I discovered that there were numerous logical problems and that many edge scenarios were not taken into account. It is a great learning opportunity for me to learn more about how to analyze the problem and understand the engineers' way of thinking.
project_4/take_away_title_2	=	Enhance the ability to go quickly into unfamiliar field
project_4/take_away_text_2	=	Reading a lot of relevant information is the quickest and most practical way to learn a new field rapidly. After that, conducting competitive analysis on related products and discussing with colleagues to share ideas will help we better understand the case's details. Due to the experience of several changes, the team also realized the value of solid knowledge from the beginning of the process.
