                    The company's original system was designed for general street lighting, in response to the difference between tunnel lighting and general street lighting, it is necessary to add the function of tunnel dimming.

                    According to the different time periods of day and night and with the measurement value of the brightness outside the tunnel, the system will automatically detect and adjust the tunnel interior lighting to provide proper brightness and save energy, thus reducing the operating cost of tunnel lighting.

                    Without experience or expertise, I researched some literature, evaluated the current system operation model, and developed a solution. After discussions with PMs and engineers, we found some practical difficulties and confusion. We conducted another competitive analysis, and iterated several versions to finalize the dimming method.

                    To prevent the "black hole effect", according to the "Tunnel Lighting Standard", the length of the tunnel can be divided into Access zone, Threshold zone, Transition zone, Interior zone, and Exit zone. The objective of this project is to enable the tunnel lights to adjust their brightness according to the luminometer. We understand that each tunnel light needs to have its own zone, and each zone has its own average brightness, and the brightness of the lights will be adjusted automatically with the brightness of the luminometer.

                    Based on competitive analysis, we found the functions and settings are separated according to the different scenarios in the current market. This is in line with Hick's Law, which states that when options increase, it takes longer for people to make decisions. By focusing on specific features for specific scenarios, users will learn how to operate more quickly.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Therefore, based on the company's current project content and future flexibility, we decided to develop templates for different scenarios in the future to provide customers with options. This part requires more staff, and in order to complete it in time, the front-end adopts the original UI design, and the design of new functions in line with the original system operation logic.                </p>

At the beginning, the design was often done in an ideal way, without considering all possible situations. Even though it is only a small change in the UI, it makes a big difference to the judgment of the program.
